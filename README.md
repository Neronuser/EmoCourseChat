# EmoryChat

Emotional neural conversational model with memory

## Getting Started

### Spacy's large English model
```
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
```

### Fasttext
```
wget https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/archive/v0.1.0.zip
unzip v0.1.0.zip
rm v0.1.0.zip
cd fastText-0.1.0
make
```
### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
